# 📘 Java Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Java Practice** repository!  
This is where I regularly add Java programs covering **DSA topics**, **OOPs concepts**, and general **Java programming** fundamentals.  
The goal is to stay consistent, track my learning, and build a solid foundation in Java 🚀
